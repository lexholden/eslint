ESLint couldn't find the plugin "<%- pluginName %>".

(The package "<%- pluginName %>" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "<%- resolvePluginsRelativeTo %>".)

If you've referenced the plugin in the `extends` array, double check that the format is `plugin:plugin-name/config-name`. There must be a slash (`/`) followed by the config name. Please consult the documentation for the plugin for more information.

If you've referenced the plugin in the `plugins` array, then it's likely the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install <%- pluginName %>@latest --save-dev

The plugin "<%- pluginName %>" was referenced from the config file in "<%- importerName %>".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
